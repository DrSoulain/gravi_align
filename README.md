# Spectral calibration/alignment of GRAVITY

[![Python 3.9](https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/amical)](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-370/)

Command-line tool to perform a spectral calibration on high-resolution GRAVITY
data.

## Installation

It is recommended to create a separate environment with `conda create -n
<env_name> python=3.7`.
Then, within your Conda env (`conda activate <env_name>`):

```bash
# Install package from github
python -m pip install git+https://github.com/DrSoulain/gravi_align
```

## How to use it?

You are supposed to be on top repo where --datadir (default: reduced/)
repository is located. This calibration step supposed that you used
`run_gravi_reduced.py` first to save the spectrum files
(`*spectrumaligned.fits`), and created all `*.sof`, `*.sh` and `*_wave.fits`. 

The first step uses the correlation map between spectrum to compute
inter-spectrum shifts. Spectral calibration is also performed to offset the entire
wavelengths table fitted with telluric lines around BrÎ³. You can add -p to plot diagnostic
figures. You can add -d
to perform the calibration using the first calibrator file. See `gravi_align
run -h` for details.

```bash
gravi_align run
```

Once good and satisfied by the alignment, you can overwrite the `*_wave.fits` with:

```bash
gravi_align run -w
```

You can check the different spectrum (`*_spectrumaligned.fits`) alignment
present in --datadir (default: reduced/):

```bash
gravi_align check
```

> Note: you are invited to select a file.

Then, you can modify the .sof corresponding to p2vm computation (add modified
`*_wave.fits` as `WAVE`) and run the p2vm recipe (esorex).

```bash
gravi_align p2vm
```

And finally, remove all the fits file in --datadir except the calibration files.
The diagnostic table is printed to check if all mandatory calibration files are present.

```bash
gravi_align clean
```

> Note: Be highly careful with this feature; the shifts computation and the
> associated `*_wave.fits` modification need to be executed before.

The calibrated `*_wave.fits` and the new associated p2vm calibration file
(`*_p2vm.fits`) are
now computed. You can now run `run_gravi_reduced.py` to finally extract your
data including the new spectral calibration.
